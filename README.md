# Diary App: Daily Reflections with Python
# youtube demo: https://youtu.be/YSD42gqDRk8?si=FuTsZlNDkupc8C89
## Description
For Hult's BOS2 section last assignment, Niccolò Arcangioli and Aaditya Baradiya, we created the Reflection Diary App, a web application developed in Python. Using Flask and Python, this project, dated March 4, 2025, with the GitHub handles Niccolo-Arcangioli and Aaditya2812, provides users with an effective way of writing daily reflections. Users can write, save, view, and delete entries full of quotes generated by an AI from a foreign API for prompts through a basic web interface. This very intricate application far exceeds the standard course problem set shows our skill in API integration, file handling, and testing and web design.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Reflection Diary App is to allow people to monitor their emotional well-being, attain mental insight, and reflect on their daily existence from various viewpoints. By the daily answer to some of the reflective affirmations, the users are in a position to develop a habit of self-reflection that makes them self-aware and self-enhancing. The app provides an open space to reflect, and the users have the liberty to write down their thoughts and revisit previous writings, incrementally developing a better idea of how they feel.

## Features
One of the most significant aspects is a web interface through which users can input their ideas in a textbox, save them for future use, and delete individual entries. Upon running project.py, a local Flask server running with a web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ is started. The tool allows self-reflection by providing users with an organized space to nurture their thoughts in and observe how they enhance themselves over time. We utilized Flask web development, requests integration into APIs, HTML/CSS to utilize for interface, and pytest for testing to create this. We defeated challenges using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT to discover suitable APIs to work with.

A simple app with quotes entered manually and file storage was a good outcome; an API-based integration for random quotes was a better outcome; and a fully tested, streamlined app with flawless user experience was the optimal outcome. We established milestones so we could measure progress. Together, leveraging our collective experience and resources, we were able to deliver our best outcome—a stable, interactive tool that simplifies daily reflection and entry management.

## Project Files

### project.py
Flask web app is included in this top-level Python file. Three additional top-level functions other than the main function (through Flask's app.run in debug mode) are:

- The `fetch_random_question` function makes use of requests to retrieve a random quote from the Advice Slip API (https://api.adviceslip.com/advice). The default is "What did you learn today?" if the API is unavailable. This gives users, even when offline, always with an on-topic prompt.

- `save_entry`: Use --- as a readability and parsing delimiter while storing user entries (date, question, and content) into diary.txt in append mode.

- `get_entries`: Read diary.txt, split the entries with ---, and parse each into a dictionary of date, question, and text. In order to nicely handle file-not-found errors, it returns an empty list.

The script comes with a web interface for user interaction and uses datetime for timestamps, random (although not used extensively here), and requests for API calls.

### test_project.py
Pytest tests have been incorporated here to cover the most crucial project.py functionality. In handling user input, the tests accommodate instant retrieval, precision, and reliability:

- By providing a promise that the function always returns a non-empty string, the `fetch_random_question` test ensures the application is able to return a quote even in case of an API failure.

- `test_save_entry`: Checks that user responses are correctly stored in diary.txt by ensuring date, question, and text are stored as user responses.

- The `test_get_entries` function deals with completed and blank diary files and ensures the entries are correctly received as a list of dictionaries in chronological order.

These tests meet project requirements for stability and reliability and ensure the primary functionality of the app.

### requirements.txt
This is a list of pip-installable libraries, found in the project root file:
- flask
- requests
- pytest

The application will not be testable and runnable without these dependencies.

## Design Choices and Reflections
Along the way, we made a few important design decisions. First was whether or not to hardcode the questions into the program or pull them from an outside API. Hardcoding would provide us with offline functionality and simplify development but close off diversity and engagement. Having scoured the relevant APIs with generative AI applications (such as ChatGPT), we selected the Advice Slip API since it gives users everytime new, inspirational prompts and free, random advice rendered in the form of quotes. We did that in order to enhance user experience but enhance chances for dependency, which we mitigated by providing a backup question in the event of unreliability ("What did you learn today?").

## Benefits of the Reflection Diary App
In contrast to conventional journaling, the Reflection Diary App provides a person with an interactive space where they can reflect, which is just one of several advantages.

- **Promotes Mental Clarity**: By writing without restrictions about what they are perceiving and feeling, a person might find out what they are experiencing, resolve issues, and gain insight into their own development with clarity.

- **Helps in Building the Habit of Reflective Thought**: Journaling regularly has been proven through empirical research to diminish anxiety, heighten positive mood, and enhance awareness. The app is enhanced by offering final, reflective questions.

- **Helps in Tracking Personal Progress**: As the users are able to read past entries, they can identify emerging patterns, know about their own progress, and map goals to be achieved based on their previous conclusions.

- **Promotes Good Health and Awareness**: By providing some minutes a day for reflection, people are able to become aware, grateful, and present, and this leads to a more conscious life.

Our collaboration was effective in splitting the work of further polishing: Niccolò took care of file management and API integration, while Aaditya took care of testing and UI logic.

This 850-word README is project documentation and speaks to our satisfaction with its completion. In API research, we have made use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT), yet maintained academic honesty by creating and authoring the content ourselves.
